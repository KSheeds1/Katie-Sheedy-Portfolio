### Surface
The light theme with dark accents was chosen to create an eye-catching first impression. The fonts are clear and legible and contrast nicely against the color scheme. 

# Features
**Navigation Bar:** 
* Fixed, in the default position, allows users to quickly identify the different sections. The font color of each section changes when hovered over. On mobile screen widths, sections are available in a collapsible menu to provide a cleaner layout on smaller screens.

**Bootstrap Cards:**
* Are utilized in the portfolio section to present my projects in bitesized chunks, they contain a link to the live site and to the github repository which are represented through  appropriate icons. 

**Progress-bars:**
* Provide a visual representation of my skills, displaying my proficiency in different languages and frameworks. 

**Embedded iframe:**
* Contains a video of the Girls in Tech Hackathon, Dublin. It provides users with a chance to see me put my skills in action within the tech arena.

## Features left to implement
**Filter option:**
* I intent to implement a filter option for the portfolio section, allowing users to filter their search of projects by technology, language, or framework. I plan to implement this feature once my portfolio grows in size.

**Navbar transitions:**
* I plan to implement a hover in/out transition for the navbar sections, where the text is replaced by an icon.

# Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap (4.5)
* Autoprefixer

# Testing 
Both the potential employer and recruiter user stories have been successfully fufilled. The about section provides brief snippets of information about me, a photo, if viewing on a desktop or tablet,
my qualilfications and highlights that I am currently available for employment opportunitites. My portfolio provides a snapshot of my most recent projects presented in cards, 
the live site and the GitHub repository for each can be accessed through the buttons provided. In regards to my skills, the progress-bars showcase my proficiency in the various languages and frameworks I am familiar with to users, while the embedded iframe
provides then with an opportunity to see how I perform within a tech-orientated setting. If users would like to contact me they can simply fill out the contact form provided. All sections of the website are clearly 
laid out in the naviagation bar, if viewing on mobile devices, the navigational links collapse into a dropdown menu. While the footer contains a downloadable copy of my CV and links to relevant accounts such as GitHub and Linkedin.

Automated testing:
* Both the HTML and CSS were validated by W3C Validation Service and passed without error. 

Manual testing: 
* All links will open on to a new tab as a result of 'target="_blank"', each link has been tested to ensure it reaches the desired destination.
* Contact form testing was achieved by:
    * Go to the 'Contact' section.
    * Attempt to submit the empty form and an error message is received to 'please fill in the required field'. 
    * Attempt to submit the form with an invaild email and an error message is received to 'please include an '@' symbol in the email address'.
    * Due to the 'required' attribute, all fields must be filled out for the form to be submitted, once all fields are filled out correctly the page will reload.
