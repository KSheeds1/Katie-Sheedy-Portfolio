### Surface
The light theme with dark accents was chosen to create an eye-catching first impression. The fonts are clear and legible and contrast nicely against the color scheme. 

# Features
**Navigation Bar:** 
* Fixed, in the default position, allows users to quickly identify the different sections. The font color of each section changes when hovered over. On mobile screen widths, sections are available in a collapsible menu to provide a cleaner layout on smaller screens.

**Bootstrap scrollSpy:**  
* Will provide users with a smooth transition between sections.

**Bootstrap Cards:**
* Are utilized in the portfolio section to present my projects in bitesized chunks, they contain a link to the live site and to the github repository which are represented through  appropriate icons. 

**Progress-bars:**
* Provide a visual representation of my skills, displaying my proficiency in different languages and frameworks. 

**Embedded iframe:**
* Contains a video of the Girls in Tech Hackathon, Dublin. It provides users with a chance to see me put my skills in action within the tech arena.

## Features left to implement
**Filter option:**
* I intent to implement a filter option for the portfolio section, allowing users to filter their search of projects by technology, language, or framework. I plan to implement this feature once my portfolio grows in size.

**Navbar transitions:**
* I plan to implement a hover in/out transition for the navbar sections, where the text is replaced by an icon.
